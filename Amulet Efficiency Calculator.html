  <h3>Insert your current color pollen (Red/Blue/White)</h3>
    <input id="colorpollen">
  <h3>Insert your current NORMAL pollen ("Pollen")</h3>
    <input id="pollen">
  <h3>Insert your CURRENT amulet to replace's color pollen (Red/Blue/White)</h3>

    <button onclick="document.getElementById('answer').innerHTML = (document.getElementById('colorpollen').value - document.getElementById('acolorpollen').value) / (document.getElementById('pollen').value - document.getElementById('apollen').value) + 'x'; /*         second box          */ document.getElementById('answerexpl').innerHTML = (document.getElementById('colorpollen').value - document.getElementById('acolorpollen').value) / (document.getElementById('pollen').value - document.getElementById('apollen').value) + '%' ">Calculate</button>

    <p>This is how much more efficient Pollen is than your specified Color Pollen: <span id="answer">[Enter the fields above]</span></p>
    <p>To explain it, adding a single % of the "Pollen" multiplier is equal to  <span id="answerexpl">[Enter the fields above]</span> of your Color Pollen multiplier. This tool is used to help you prioritize the Pollen while sacrificing the Color Pollen (because you cant have the best rng on earth, can you)</p>
    <p>The amulet you enter above is the amulet with low or no "Pollen" multiplier and to show you how much more useful the pollen multiplier is for your color than your color's pollen (And other colors for a fact)</p>
    <p>Additionally while you are collecting pollen your SSA, Bees, etc. increase your color pollen way more than Pollen. So maybe while grinding you can also try the tool</p>
<br><br>

    <p>(Note that you must do it fast and outside of grinding to avoid any changes, but if theres nectar's, a 1% or so decrease will not mean much, but will be accurate if taken at same time)</p>
    <p>(Amulet color pollen is optional, if u don't want to use it just enter 0)</p>
    <br><h3>Long AI definition if you dont understand mine</h3><br>
    <p>Current Color Pollen (Red/Blue/White): Enter the current value of your color pollen multiplier. This is the multiplier for the specific color of pollen you are collecting.<br>
      Current Normal Pollen (“Pollen”): Enter the current value of your normal pollen multiplier. This is the general multiplier for all types of pollen.<br>
      Current Amulet’s Color Pollen (Red/Blue/White): Enter the color pollen multiplier of the amulet you are considering to replace. This is the multiplier for the specific color of pollen that the amulet provides.<br>
      Current Amulet’'s Normal Pollen (“Pollen”): Enter the normal pollen multiplier of the amulet you are considering to replace. This is the general multiplier for all types of pollen that the amulet provides.<br>
      Calculate Button: Click this button to calculate the efficiency of the normal pollen multiplier compared to the color pollen multiplier. The calculation is based on the difference between your current multipliers and the multipliers of the amulet you are considering to replace.<br>
      Efficiency Result: This dis`plays how much more efficient the normal pollen multiplier is compared to the color pollen multiplier. A higher value indicates that the normal pollen multiplier is more beneficial.<br>
      Explanation: This explains that adding a single percentage point to the normal pollen multiplier is equivalent to adding the displayed number of percentage points to the color pollen multiplier. This helps you understand the trade-off between the two types of multipliers.<br>
      Amulet Consideration: This explains that the amulet you entered above is being considered for its low or non-existent normal pollen multiplier. It shows you how much more beneficial the normal pollen multiplier is for your specific color of pollen.<br>
      Additional Information: This explains that while you are collecting pollen, other factors such as your SSA, Bees, etc., increase your color pollen more than the normal pollen. Therefore, you might want to consider using this tool while grinding.<br>
      Notes: These provide additional information and considerations when using the tool. For example, it suggests performing the calculation quickly and outside of grinding to avoid any changes in the multipliers. It also mentions that the amulet’s color pollen is optional and can be set to 0 if not used.<br>
      Remember, this tool is designed to help you prioritize the normal pollen multiplier while sacrificing the color pollen multiplier, as achieving the best RNG is not always possible. It provides a way to compare the benefits of different multipliers and make informed decisions about which amulets to use.</p>
